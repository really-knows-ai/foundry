# Changelog

## 2.2.0 — 2026-04-19

### Breaking changes

- **`foundry_artefacts_add` removed.** Artefact registration now happens exclusively via `foundry_stage_finalize` after a forge stage closes.
- **`foundry_artefacts_set_status` no longer accepts `draft`.** Only `done` and `blocked` are valid. New artefacts are registered as `draft` automatically by `stage_finalize`.
- **Feedback / artefact / workfile mutation tools now enforce stage-lock preconditions.** Tools callable by subagents require an active stage matching their role; tools callable by the orchestrator require no active stage. Out-of-band calls return a structured error instead of mutating state.
- **Feedback state machine strictly enforced.** `approved` is terminal. `quench` cannot approve/reject `wont-fix` items. See `HARDEN.md` §4 for the full matrix.
- **`foundry_sort` dispatchable routes now return a `token` field.** Subagents must redeem the token via `foundry_stage_begin`; forged or replayed tokens are rejected.

### New

- **`foundry_stage_begin(stage, cycle, token)`** — subagents open a work stage by consuming a single-use HMAC-signed token.
- **`foundry_stage_end(summary)`** — subagents close a stage; preserves `baseSha` for finalize.
- **`foundry_stage_finalize(cycle)`** — orchestrator verifies stage output against allowed file patterns, registers matching files as draft artefacts, rejects stray writes with `{error: "unexpected_files", files: [...]}`.
- **`.foundry/` state directory** (gitignored) — holds `.secret` (per-worktree HMAC key, mode 0600), `active-stage.json` (present only during an active stage), `last-stage.json` (for finalize lookup).

### Fixed

- Normalized `maxIterations` → `max-iterations` across workfile read/write paths (previously inconsistent between flow and cycle skills, causing latent deadlock-detection issues).

### Migration

Upgrade with the `upgrade-foundry` skill. `.foundry/` is created automatically on first plugin boot; `.secret` is generated idempotently. No data migration required — existing `WORK.md` and `foundry/*` configs are compatible.
